    1. Purpose

    The Digital Talking Book Document Type Definition (DTD) provides
    the means to mark up the text of a document to permit support for
    the combination of professional narration and navigation into that
    narration. It also facilitates the output of a document's content in
    a variety of accessible formats. The markup tags in the book convey
    its content in structure, and contain some metadata about the book
    content and its structure.

    The Document Type Definition names and defines the allowable element
    types, their allowable content, and their attributes. Correct markup
    of the text of the book permits the textual material to be synchronized
    using SMIL [SMIL2.0] files with the professionally narrated version of
    that book. The synchronization can permit concurrent display of the
    text being narrated. The textual content can be searched in context to
    locate material desired for narration.

    More detailed documentation of this dtbook dtd [DTBOOKV20052DTD] is
    available as an html document. See [DTBOOKV20052DOC].

    1.1. Prior Related Work

    The DAISY (Digital Accessible Information SYstem) Consortium
    contributed substantially to the development of this DTD.
    This application of XML is the next generation after several DAISY
    versions of 2.X specifications, see [DAISY202].

    The DAISY Statement of Principles for the Creation and Production
    of Accessible Books and Materials [DAISY-2-GUIDELINES] represents
    the minimum standard to be met by Libraries of the Blind and producers
    of alternative format materials.

    Its Navigation Control Center (NCC) provided for synchronizing
    document structure with narration.

    The NCC evolved into an XML application called the "Navigation Control
    File for XML applications" (NCX). Its content is derived from
    the markup of documents tagged using the dtbook DTD. Richer
    structuring capability is one of the objectives of that DTD. The
    Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language [SMIL2.0] is used
    to provide synchronized narrations and text. The NCX provides
    navigation using the identified elements of documents tagged to this DTD.

    The dtbook DTD includes many, but not all, of the element types found
    in both the [HTML401STRICT] and [XHTML11STRICT] strict DTDs. HTML
    authoring tools permit those additional element tags, and may ignore
    the additional tags that are dtbook-specific. The lowercase names
    from XHTML are used, rather than the uppercase names from HTML.

    1.2. Evolution from HTML and XHTML


    Dtbook-2005-2 has 83 element types. It shares 46 element types with the
    HTML4.0 Strict DTD [HTML401STRICT] (as adjusted to use the lower-case
    names consonant with the XHTML Strict DTD [XHTML11STRICT]). It omits
    31 element types from them, and has 32 unique element types.

    Endtag markup is sometimes optional in HTML. It is required for use with
    xhtml and dtbook. Any XML application [XML12] requires endtags, or their
    abbreviated form for empty elements, such as "<link />". The benefit of
    including endtags is that the tagged document has dependable structure
    that can be validated against the dtbook dtd.

    Some tools available for browsing HTML may be used with dtbook
    material, at the expense of their discarding or ignoring some specific
    tagging and attributes that are not part of HTML 4.0. A CSS-based
    stylesheet [CSS1] or [CSS2] that identifies the presentation expectations
    for the HTML and non-HTML tags, or a filter to map those tags onto
    suitable HTML tags can provide appropriate visual presentation.

    2. Document Prolog

    A Digital Talking Book document is an XML application. Therefore, it
    must begin with the XML declaration, followed by the DOCTYPE
    declaration.

    2.1. XML Declaration

    The XML declaration identifies the version of XML, and the
    optional character set encoding for the document:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>



    2.2. Character Set Encodings (removed as redundant; unicode suffices)




    2.3. DOCTYPE Declaration

    The document type declaration, the DOCTYPE, follows. It has several forms.
    The simpler form assumes that the proper version of the dtbook DTD
    is in the same directory as the dtbook file itself.

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook SYSTEM
            "dtbook-2005-2.dtd">

    A more general form provides the PUBLIC URI from which the SYSTEM
    filename can be substituted, should that system copy be missing:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook PUBLIC
            "http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/dtbook-2005-2.dtd"
            "dtbook-2005-2.dtd">

    That assumes the URI can be reached, which may not be true for
    portable dtbook players.

    The still more general form recommended for xml applications [XML12] is:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook PUBLIC
            "-//NISO//DTD dtbook 2005-2//EN"
            "http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/dtbook-2005-2.dtd">

    where the Formal Public Identifier (FPI) on the second line is converted
    to the URI where it may be publicly found:

    http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/dtbook-2005-2.dtd

    The [OASIS-TR9401] Entity Management Catalog provides an indirect
    means to provide that mapping from FPI to the dtd.

    That catalog is more generally useful to provide the mapping from
    any external entity names (such as modules) to URIs where they may
    be found.

    Note that the reference above is to a particular version of the DTD,
    distinguished by the string "2005-2".

    2.4. Digital Talking Book File MIME Type

    A Digital Talking Book document is tagged to the dtbook XML
    application. Its MIME media-type is "text/xml". The tagged book
    filename should have suffix ".xml". See [RFC2045].

    3. Modular Extension to the DTD

    The dtbook DTD has four parameter entities defined that provide means
    to allow an individual book to modularly extend the content models:

        <!ENTITY % externalblock "">
        <!ENTITY % externalinline "">
        <!ENTITY % externalFlow "">
        <!ENTITY % externalNamespaces "">

    These parameter entities appear in corresponding block and inline
    content models. With this "" content they have no effect on books
    tagged to the dtbook DTD. In a book that needs a modular extension,
    values are given by redefinition in the internal subset of that book.
    This extends the dtbook DTD without having to change it.

    A book can augment the dtbook DTD by including other declarations
    or parameter entity references in the internal subset of declarations.
    The internal subset may occur in square brackets following the
    ExternalID and before the concluding ">" of the initial DOCTYPE
    declaration that identifies the dtbook DTD.

    Those additional markup declarations in the internal subset
    take preference over any in the dtbook DTD itself. The effective
    DTD is thereby augmented by the parameter entity values and any other
    declarations of the book's internal subset. When a given parameter
    entity declaration appears more than once in the external modules and
    the dtbook DTD, the first occurrence of that declaration is the one
    that takes effect, with modules in the internal subset being processed
    in order, before the DTD itself.

    For example:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook SYSTEM
        "dtbook.dtd"
        [
            <!ENTITY % dramaModule SYSTEM "drama.dtd">
            %dramaModule;
            <!ENTITY % externalblock "| d:drama">
            <!ENTITY % externalinline "| d:character">
            <!ENTITY % externalFlow "| d:stagedir">
            <!ENTITY % externalNamespaces "xmlns:d CDATA #FIXED 'http://www.sample.org/drama'">
        ]>

    The "%dramaModule;" invocation causes all declarations made within
    dramaModule to become the initial part of the dtbook DTD. Within the
    book, the empty entity declarations for % externalblock, 
    % externalinline, % externalFlow, and %externalNamespaces
    are replaced by these new definitions. Thus the
    block element d:drama can appear wherever block elements may occur in
    dtbook, d:character can appear wherever inline elements may occur, and
    d:stagedir can appear in either block or inline contexts.  Note that
    each extension element must appear in no more than one of these three
    entities. The namespace attribute xmlns:d can occur on any element with 
    the fixed value of "http://www.sample.org/drama".

    More than one module may be needed and included in a book, for example
    both poem and drama can appear in the internal subset of the book.
    For example, the internal subset of the book could contain:

        <!DOCTYPE dtbook SYSTEM
        "dtbook.dtd"
        [
            <!ENTITY % poemModule SYSTEM "poem.dtd">
            %poemModule;
            <!ENTITY % dramaModule SYSTEM "drama.dtd">
            %dramaModule;
            <!ENTITY % externalblock "| poem | stanza | verse | drama">
            <!ENTITY % externalinline "| stagedir">
        ]>

    Such external modules need to include the definitions of any parameter
    entities that are used in the modules since their definitions are needed
    before they can be expanded in their references. They cannot depend
    on parameter entities in the SystemLiteral or PubidLiteral.

    Note that arbitrary external modules from other sources may not have
    all the needed attributes. XML allows augmentation of ATTLISTs in the
    internal subset. Additional attribute names can be added to an
    associated element type. Any redefinitions of a particular named
    attribute resulting from presence in the internal subset have
    precedence.

    Note that tools and players processing any extended markup that affects
    navigation structure will need to know of those modular extensions.

    The form above for augmenting the dtbook dtd through the document's
    internal subset does not require the XML namespace mechanism, with
    its namespace-specific prefix on element and attribute names to
    disambiguate any potential name collisions. However, use of XML
    namespaces [XML-NAMES] is recommended.

    [HTML401STRICT] "HTML 4.0 Strict DTD," 1999-12-24, Dave Raggett,
    Arnaud Le hors, and Ian Jacobs. Dtbook110 was originally based on
    the HTML 4.0 Strict DTD with design adaptation for dtbook110.
    A principal adaptation is to use lower-case names for element types
    and attribute names. For expanded discussion, see [HTML401].

    Dtbook110 (and now Dtbook122) is partially harmonized with the

    The XHTML camelCase parameter entity names are retained, and comments
    and references following those parameter entities explain them. The

    <!--showin attribute applies for text elements to permit identification
        of the kinds of display appropriate for the element, so presentation
        choice by the reader among alternative readings can be provided, when
        appropriate. Values of showin are coded with three letters in order:
        "b"=Braille, "l"=Largeprint, and "p"=Print; or "x"=inappropriate:

            Value  Braille  Largeprint Print   Interpretation

        There is no default value; this attribute value is implied
        from the most immediate ancestor that specifies a value.
        The usual default for showin is 'blp'. If only one showin
        value is needed it should be included with <book>.

        Different content for the same element (usually <prodnote>) meeting
        different needs is possible, with showin serving as a switch to
        differentiate among them. Both largeprint and print are appropriate
        for screen rendering as well as printing. Different corresponding
        styles may be appropriate.

        It is possible to include equivalent content from any major structure
        below <book> to provide the different content suitable for different
        media. These would be independent, sharing no direct content, possibly
        having common references to images, with different accompanying text
        descriptions.
