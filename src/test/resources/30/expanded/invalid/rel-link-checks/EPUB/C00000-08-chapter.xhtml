        <p>
            <span id="d910e3707">
                <span id="dtb822">Blind individuals have probably been educated to some degree or other in a number of countries throughout the world for many centuries </span>
                <a id="dtb823" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_82">82</a>
                <span id="dtb824">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb825">Organised education of the blind, however, did not exist before the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb826">D.G. </span>
            <span id="dtb827">Pritchard (1965) demonstrated that organised education of the blind began in Britain in the 1780s, independent of Haüy, but that rumours of his work reached that country
                after a few years. </span>
            <span id="dtb828">Education of the blind in Britain, which was entirely private, initially only aimed at teaching the pupils some sort of handicraft while education proper can be said to
                have commenced in 1800.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb829">Education of the blind in the German-speaking world began, give or take a few years, at the period when Haüy initiated his activities. </span>
            <span id="dtb830">In both cases John Locke and other Enlightenment philosophers exerted a powerful influence over the pioneers of education for the blind. </span>
            <span id="d910e3743">
                <span id="dtb831">Another pioneer in this field was Johan Wilhelm Klein, who in 1804 founded an institute for the blind in Vienna </span>
                <a id="dtb832" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_83">83</a>
                <span id="dtb833">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="d910e3755">
                <span id="dtb834">From the first, Klein regarded his school as a public concern </span>
                <a id="dtb835" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_84">84</a>
                <span id="dtb836"> and his real wish was to integrate blind children into ordinary classes. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb837">Klein's institute was from the outset financed by the State, while the institute which Haüy and Zeune founded in Berlin in 1806 also received State funds.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="d910e3773">
                <span id="dtb838">The birth of Swedish education for the blind is usually considered to have occurred in 1807 </span>
                <a id="dtb839" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_85">85</a>
                <span id="dtb840">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb841">At that time, the Keeper of Royal Records, Pär Aron Borg, received a visit from the 24- year old Charlotta Seijerling, who had become blind at the age of four and later
                boarded with the Borg family where she was taught music, writing, arithmetic, German, French, etc. </span>
            <span id="d910e3788">
                <span id="dtb842">In Berättelse om den i Maj månad 1808 med en blind Elev hållne första Examen (The story of the first exam taken by a blind pupil in May 1808), Pär Aron Borg describes
                    the public examination of Charlotta Seijerling, who was able to demonstrate her skill in reading, singing, playing the piano and the harp and also in "a number of handicrafts,
                    which she had been taught such as spinning, knitting and needlework; and she had, particularly in the latter crafts, acquired such skill that she was able to show a sweater which
                    she had made for herself". </span>
                <a id="dtb843" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_86">86</a>
                <span id="dtb844">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb845">This examination was held prior to the funding of the institute. </span>
            <span id="dtb846">Borg points out that he had only been able to teach her in his "spare moments" and that Seijerling would probably have achieved much better results if she had been able
                to dedicate more time to her education.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb847">After this public examination, Borg asked the king, King Gustav IV Adolf, to contribute financially to extending the institute's activities so that greater numbers of
                blind persons could be taught. </span>
            <span id="dtb848">In his letter to the king, he also requested permission to teach the deaf. </span>
            <span id="d910e3816">
                <span id="dtb849">Borg's petition met with approval and he was granted an annual personal allowance of 450 riksdaler banco </span>
                <a id="dtb850" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_87">87</a>
                <span id="dtb851">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb852">Johansson is of the opinion that this decision led to the establishment in Sweden of an institute for the blind, the deaf and the mentally infirm.</span>
        </p>
        <div id="page_24" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="24"></div>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb853">The allowance continued to be paid after the events of March 1809, when Gustav IV Adolf was forced to abdicate in favour of his uncle (Carl XIII).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="d910e3843">
                <span id="dtb854">In his application to the monarch for funds, Borg also committed himself to holding annual public examinations of the institute's pupils, as demanded by the new
                    régime, which at the same time had increased the institute's funding </span>
                <a id="dtb855" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_88">88</a>
                <span id="dtb856">.</span>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb857">During the Autumn and Winter of 1808 to 1809, Borg initiated teaching activities on a larger scale, by accepting six deaf pupils and one blind pupil. </span>
            <span id="d910e3861">
                <span id="dtb858">Borg claimed that he was familiar with the educational methods in vogue in other countries in Europe, but that he preferred to follow his own ideas </span>
                <a id="dtb859" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_89">89</a>
                <span id="dtb860">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb861">With regard to the deaf, however, he allowed himself to be oriented by l'épée in his use of sign language and the finger alphabet. </span>
            <span id="dtb862">Handicrafts formed an important part of his teaching methods, as they had for Haüy.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb863">Johansson (1974) believes that it is difficult to form an idea of how the handicapped pupils were taught during the institute's early years on the basis of the material
                which has survived. </span>
            <span id="d910e3885">
                <span id="dtb864">Because of the shortage of blind pupils, the institute eventually accepted only deaf children </span>
                <a id="dtb865" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_90">90</a>
                <span id="dtb866">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb867">Pär Aron Borg left the institute in 1818, after a series of conflicts, to found a private institute for the deaf in Manhem.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb868">Serious debate on organised education for the blind and deaf did not develop until the introduction of the Elementary Schools Law in 1842. </span>
            <span id="d910e3907">
                <span id="dtb869">During the parliamentary session of 1844 to 1845, education for the disabled was discussed, and in the course of that debate it was in fact suggested that this type
                    of education should be integrated into the general elementary school system </span>
                <a id="dtb870" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_91">91</a>
                <span id="dtb871">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb872">The decision to create a separate school for the blind was taken in the Riddarhus (House of the Nobility) by Nils af Zellén, head of department at the Ministry of
                Education and Ecclesiastic Affairs. </span>
            <span id="dtb873">In this debate, Zellén particularly emphasised the element of self-sufficiency and referred to the fact that most civilised countries in Europe had developed a system of
                education which helped the blind to become self-supporting.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="d910e3928">
                <span id="dtb874">Ossian Edmund Borg, the son of Pär Aron Borg, had become director of the General Institute for the Deaf at Manilla and was sent on a tour of Denmark, Germany, Belgium
                    and France for the purpose of studying the progress of the education for the blind in these countries </span>
                <a id="dtb875" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_92">92</a>
                <span id="dtb876">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb877">In 1846, the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) decided that a new department for the blind should be established at Manilla. </span>
            <span id="dtb878">This regulation of education for the deaf and blind was a symptom, in Förhammars opinion, of the socializing ideas which had inspired the Elementary School Law of 1842. </span>
            <span id="dtb879">The blind were offered 13 free places (one from each diocese) at the Manilla institute. </span>
            <span id="dtb880">The curriculum was to include reading, writing, Luther's catechism and handicrafts. </span>
            <span id="dtb881">Musical skills would also be taught. </span>
            <span id="d910e3956">
                <span id="dtb882">The children would attend the institute from 12 to 18 years of age </span>
                <a id="dtb883" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_93">93</a>
                <span id="dtb884">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb885">Prior to that, they would be admitted to the school in the locality in which they officially resided.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb886">In Denmark, the situation was somewhat different. </span>
            <span id="d910e3977">
                <span id="dtb887">The Kjaeden Order had been founded towards the end of the 18th century; one of its activities was helping the blind </span>
                <a id="dtb888" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_94">94</a>
                <span id="dtb889">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb890">Originally the Order ran an asylum which admitted a certain number of blind persons who were taught handicrafts. </span>
            <span id="dtb891">This idea originated in France, where the Philanthropic Society carried out similar activities.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb892">Word of the school for the blind in Paris reached Copenhagen, and in 1803, a young doctor by the name of P.A. </span>
            <span id="dtb893">Castberg was commissioned by the Danish government (Cancelliet) to travel to Paris to study in the first place the education of the blind but also to "investigate the
                organisation of the institutes for the blind which exist in Paris, where the blind, each according to his capacity, are educated to become useful citizens since they are taught
                different skills in the production of a variety of articles."</span>
        </p>
        <div id="page_25" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="25"></div>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb894">Castberg spent the winter of 1804 to 1805 in Paris but there is no written testimony of his having informed the Institute for Blind Youth in Copenhagen of what he had
                observed. </span>
            <span id="dtb895">This is probably because the institute was not efficiently organised at that time. </span>
            <span id="d910e4016">
                <span id="dtb896">A letter from Castberg, however, contains an interesting piece of information; he mentions that during his stay in Paris he tried to buy Haüy's book but that only
                    second-hand copies were to be had </span>
                <a id="dtb897" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_95">95</a>
                <span id="dtb898">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb899">He bought three copies, one of which he kept for himself. </span>
            <span id="dtb900">One of the other copies eventually arrived in Dresden, where it was translated into German.</span>

                <span id="dtb901">A pamphlet entitled Journal udgiven til Fordel for Blinde was published in 1811 in Copenhagen in which an article on Haüy, written by Daniel Fürst, a merchant,
                    appeared </span>
                <a id="dtb902" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_96">96</a>
                <span id="dtb903">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb904">Fürst writes that he spent six months in 1805 in daily contact with Haüy and that he had learned how to teach the blind from him. </span>
            <span id="dtb905">It is not known whether Castberg and Fürst knew each other or whether they had met in Paris. </span>
            <span id="dtb906">Castberg eventually became a leading figure in education for the deaf in Denmark and in 1818 was appointed head of the Manilla Institute in Stockholm.</span>

            <span id="dtb907">Johansen states that in 1810 the Kjaeden Order was interested in expanding its activities and that one of its members, Brother C.F. </span>
            <span id="dtb908">Brorson, suggested the creation of a school for blind children. </span>
            <span id="dtb909">Frederick VI supported the project and personally contributed funds towards it. </span>
            <span id="dtb910">He himself inaugurated the institute and named it "The Royal Institute for the Blind". </span>
            <span id="dtb911">Johansen could find no evidence to indicate that Fürst was a member of the Kjaeden Order, although he did find proof that he had approached Brorson after the creation of
                the institute for the blind and offered to teach there without compensation. </span>
            <span id="dtb912">The institute's curriculum included reading and writing and Fürst is said to have taught those subjects. </span>
            <span id="dtb913">Johansen, however, believes that education at the institute could not have been very successful, as Brorson was a decided opponent of the purchase of a printing press for
                the production of raised print books. </span>
            <span id="dtb914">The Danish Museum for the Blind, in spite of this opposition to the printing press, contains both a typographic case produced by Haüy and a copy of his famous essay. </span>
            <span id="dtb915">Were they perhaps Fürst's? </span>
            <span id="dtb916">Is the book one of the three copies Castberg bought in Paris? </span>
            <span id="dtb917">These questions remain unanswered. </span>
            <span id="dtb918">In the 1850s, management of the institute was taken over by the State. </span>
            <span id="dtb919">Nationalisation was preceded by a commission headed by Professor N.G. </span>
            <span id="dtb920">Melchior who had visited the institute in Paris in 1852 and seen for himself that blind pupils could learn to read with the help of raised print books. </span>
            <span id="d910e4106">
                <span id="dtb921">He later stated in his report that the Danish institute had not kept up with developments in this field </span>
                <a id="dtb922" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_97">97</a>
                <span id="dtb923">. </span>
            </span>
            <span id="dtb924">As a result of Melchior's report, the commission suggested that the institute should employ special teachers to teach the blind pupils to read and write. </span>
            <span id="dtb925">They should learn not only to write in ink in order to be able to communicate with the sighted, but also the Braille system so that they could communicate with one
                another. </span>
            <span id="dtb926">It was further suggested in the report that in their own interest blind children should be taught in their local school during their early years. </span>
            <span id="dtb927">They would then be admitted to the Institute for the Blind at the age of eleven.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dtb928">Melchior later travelled to England to acquire suitable writing aids for the blind pupils.</span>

            <span id="dtb929">In 1855, Haüy's Essai sur l'Education des Aveugles was translated into Danish by a young blind man by the name of Hans S/ondring. </span>
            <span id="dtb930">The Danish translation was called Om de Blinde (About the Blind). </span>
            <span id="dtb931">The National Institute for the Blind was inaugurated in 1856; the Kjaeden Order's final contribution to the education of blind children was to assume the costs of the new
                school building. </span>
            <span id="dtb932">The Order is still in existence and funds research into the history of the blind. </span>
            <span id="dtb933">From all this, it is obvious that Haüy's methods did not reach Denmark until the middle of the 19th century, in spite of Fürst's activities.</span>
