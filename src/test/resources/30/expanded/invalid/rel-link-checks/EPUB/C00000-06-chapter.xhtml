            <p>
                <span id="dtb201">Special education for the deaf, the visually handicapped and the disabled has its roots in the France of the Enlightenment, a period of growing interest in the
                    creation of organised education for the handicapped. </span>
                <span id="d910e1036">
                    <span id="dtb202">In 1760, the abbé l'épée founded the first school for the deaf, where his educational methods were based on the teaching of sign language </span>

                    <span id="dtb205">Interest in education methods for the disabled began to develop seriously in the early years of the 19th century </span>

                <span id="d910e1063">
                    <span id="dtb208">The debate on the social value of the handicapped and their learning capacity began with John Locke (1632-1704) and his essay "The Molyneux Problem," included in
                        "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" </span>
                    <a id="dtb209" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_7">7</a>
                    <span id="dtb210">. </span>
                </span>
                <span id="dtb211">Locke received a letter from William Molyneux, an Irishman, dated 2nd March 1693, in which the following question was posed: "If a person who was born blind, and who
                    has learnt to distinguish by touch between a cube and a sphere regains vision after an operation, will he then be able to distinguish the cube from the sphere by sight alone?" </span>
                <span id="d910e1078">
                    <a id="dtb212" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_8">8</a>
                    <span id="dtb213">.</span>
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb214">Locke had a great influence on the French philosophers of the Enlightenment, and the famous debate on the "Molyneux problem" inspired the French philosopher Denis
                    Diderot (1713-1784) to make contact with blind people and later publish his experiences in a pamphlet, Lettre sur les Aveugles pour Ceux qui voient (A Letter to the Blind for Those
                    Who Can See). </span>
                <span id="dtb215">His letter served several purposes. </span>
                <span id="dtb216">On the one hand, Diderot exposed a fraud which had taken place in the drawing-room of the scientist S.A. </span>
                <span id="d910e1099">
                    <span id="dtb217">Réaumur , while on the other he made a number of observations which were a radical criticism of the conventional ideas of the time </span>
                    <a id="dtb218" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_9">9</a>
                    <span id="dtb219">. </span>
                </span>
                <span id="dtb220">The fraud in question consisted of a performance by a girl who claimed to be blind in Réaumur's drawing-room during which she played, sang and answered a series of
                    general knowledge questions (for example, the length of certain rivers, the names of European cities, etc.). </span>
                <span id="dtb221">Diderot unmasked this humbug, but also pointed out that fraudulent performances were unnecessary, since the blind could in fact be educated. </span>
                <span id="dtb222">As an example of this, he mentioned the blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson. </span>
                <span id="d910e1121">
                    <span id="dtb223">In the second half of his letter, Diderot has Saunderson express, in an imaginary dialogue, his own atheistic philosophy of life, for which Diderot paid with a
                        brief sojourn in prison </span>
                    <a id="dtb224" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_10">10</a>

                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb226">Diderot's letter made the bourgeoisie of the time aware that the blind could in fact be educated. </span>
                <span id="d910e1139">
                    <span id="dtb227">He went on to found a philanthrophic society in 1780 - the Société Philanthropique </span>

                    <span id="dtb230">These "homes for the blind" -"Maisons des Enfans-Aveugles"- took in blind persons between the ages of 20 and 25 </span>

                    <span id="dtb234">Diderot himself had a blind pupil, Mélanie de Salignac (1741-1763), who was his friend Sophie Volland's niece </span>

                <span id="dtb239">She could read and write and, what is particularly interesting, she wrote in raised print, which Haüy then experimented with on a larger scale.</span>

            <p>
                <span id="dtb241">Valentin Haüy was born on 13th November 1745 in Saint-Just en Chaussé (Picardy), a small village approximately 35 km east of Paris. </span>
                <span id="dtb242">His father was a weaver. </span>
                <span id="d910e1215">
                    <span id="dtb243">Haüy's elder brother, the abbé René Just Haüy (1743-1822), was the pioneer of crystallography (the science of the structure, forms and property of crystals) and
                        played an important role in the introduction of the metric system </span>

            <p>
                <span id="dtb246">In 1751, the family took up residence in Paris and the two brothers began to attend a school run by a Catholic order. </span>
                <span id="dtb247">Later, both of them studied at the Sorbonne; Valentin studied Latin, Greek and Hebrew and was said to be fluent in about ten modern languages. </span>
                <span id="dtb248">He earned a living as a translator of private and public documents and was soon able to boast the title of Royal Interpreter. </span>
                <span id="dtb249">He was also interpreter to the city council of Paris and the Admiralty. </span>
                <span id="dtb250">Before his appointment as royal interpreter he had become senior master in a secondary school. </span>
                <span id="d910e1246">
                    <span id="dtb251">He later became a member of the Bureau Académique des écritures, founded by Louis XVI, probably because he had invented a method of deciphering secret codes and
                        military code systems </span>
                    <a id="dtb252" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_15">15</a>

                </span>
                <span id="dtb254">In 1771, the French police began to take an interest in deciphering codes, and during the following ten years, Valentin Haüy worked for the secret police, where his
                    task was to investigate all foreign correspondence carried by the French postal service and to decipher secret documents. </span>
                <span id="dtb255">He continued these activities under the various revolutionary governments in the latter part of the century.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb256">Haüy was also interested in the education of the deaf. </span>
                <span id="d910e1270">
                    <span id="dtb257">He is said to have been actively involved in the teaching of deaf pupils and to have worked from time to time with the abbé l'épée </span>

                    <span id="dtb264">In a letter to his son, Haüy tells how during the annual market in St Ovid's Square in Paris, he saw blind musicians from the Quinze-Vingt asylum perform </span>

                </span>
                <span id="dtb267">He was sitting at a café when he saw some very strange creatures fitted with huge paper spectacles and pointed hats with donkey's ears affixed to them. </span>
                <span id="dtb268">Sheet music was placed upside down on the blind musicians' music stands while they banged, blew, and squeezed noises out of their worn-out instruments.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb269">Haüy was shocked by the way the disabled musicians' wretchedness was exaggerated by their ridiculous outfits. </span>
                <span id="dtb270">He was also upset by the callousness of the audience, who howled with laughter at this shambles of an orchestra. </span>
                <span id="dtb271">Haüy did not see any reason to laugh at people just because they had a physical impediment.</span>

                <span id="dtb283">Maria Theresia von Paradis was a woman who had a significant influence on Haüy and his teaching methods. </span>
                <span id="dtb284">They met in Paris in 1785 while Paradis was on a concert tour of Europe. </span>
                <span id="dtb285">Weygand (1998) says that Haüy read an article in a Parisian newspaper informing the public that the blind child prodigy Mara Theresia von Paradis was in the city and
                    decided to contact her. </span>
                <span id="d910e1409">
                    <span id="dtb286">Maria Theresia von Paradis was born in Vienna and became blind at about 4 years of age </span>

                <span id="dtb290">Her father was a well-to-do lawyer. </span>
                <span id="dtb291">Maria Theresia was extremely musical and became a virtuoso on the piano; she had her own school in Vienna where she taught piano and singing. </span>
                <span id="dtb292">Between 1784 and 1785, she toured Europe, playing at the courts of Paris, London, Brussels, Hanover and Berlin, and giving concerts in several other cities. </span>
                <span id="dtb293">Mozart composed a concerto for piano and orchestra especially for her European tour and von Paradis also wrote her own music, using a system for writing musical notes
                    which she had had specially invented. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb294">Before von Paradis set off on her grand tour of Europe, she had relief maps made of the different countries and cities she was to visit. </span>
                <span id="dtb295">On these maps, frontiers and rivers were embroidered in backstitch, while cities and towns were represented by different-sized buttons; large buttons for capitals,
                    smaller buttons for smaller cities or towns. </span>
                <span id="d910e1446">
                    <span id="dtb296">Von Paradis had raised texts printed; a special printing press was made for her by Wolfgang Ritter von Kempelen </span>

                <span id="dtb300">Their letters show that they discussed how raised pictures and maps could be made. </span>

                <span id="dtb316">Not until thirteen years after the market in St Ovid's Square did he have an opportunity to demonstrate that the blind could be educated. </span>
                <span id="dtb317">This occurred when he was invited to teach François Lesueur, or Le Sueur, as Didier-Weygand sometimes writes his name.</span>

                <span id="d910e1553">
                    <span id="dtb318">Haüy first met Lesueur, standing begging at the entrance to the church of Saint-Germain-des Prés </span>

                    <span id="dtb321">Lesueur was a professional beggar who supported himself, his parents and four siblings with the money he was given by churchgoers (since the Middle Ages, the
                        Catholic Church had allowed the blind to beg outside churches) </span>

                    <span id="dtb324">The story goes on to tell how Haüy, when he gave Lesueur some money, was told, "You thought you gave me a measly sou when in fact it was an écu " </span>

                </span>
                <span id="dtb327">From this incident Haüy immediately drew conclusions regarding the fine sense of touch the blind possess. </span>
                <span id="dtb328">If we compare this version of their meeting with Haüy's own words in section 3.3, we can guess how the story originated.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb329">Haüy started by teaching Lesueur good manners, grammatically correct speech and arithmetic. </span>
                <span id="dtb330">Haüy's main interest, however, was teaching the blind to read. </span>
                <span id="dtb331">He had wooden letters made so that Lesueur could learn the alphabet and later learn to read. </span>
                <span id="dtb332">This was achieved by forming the letters into words in a wooden frame. </span>
                <span id="dtb333">In a similar way, Lesueur learned the four arithmetical rules; in this case, wooden numbers were placed in different compartments in a frame. </span>
                <span id="dtb334">A major problem proved to be a supply of books for Lesueur. </span>
                <span id="dtb335">Haüy soon realised that his pupil could recognise raised letters, so he began to produce raised letters on waxed paper. </span>
                <span id="dtb336">Haüy had started teaching Lesueur on 31st May 1784. </span>
                <span id="d910e1626">
                    <span id="dtb337">By September of the same year, he was able to announce his progress in an article in the Journal de Paris </span>

                </span>
                <span id="dtb340">On November 18th, both teacher and pupil appeared before the Académie de l'écriture. </span>
                <span id="dtb341">It was common practice at that time for pupils to appear before the Academy and the Court, and not just "handicapped prodigies". </span>
                <span id="d910e1645">
                    <span id="dtb342">The Academy apparently fulfilled some kind of educational inspecting and authorising function </span>

                <span id="dtb346">This made Haüy's name as a teacher of the blind. </span>

                <span id="dtb360">A year later, when the number of pupils had increased, he moved into a house in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, where the Société Philanthropique had its workshop
                    for the blind, and so l'Institution des Jeunes Aveugles (the Institute for Blind Children ) was born. </span>

            <p>
                <span id="dtb392">In his essay Haüy expounds his pedagogical theories and presents a programme of studies for blind children. </span>
                <span id="dtb393">His basic premise was that the "unfortunate Blind," who until then had been deprived of education, could in fact be educated and ought therefore to be given the
                    opportunity to attend school and learn a trade by which they could later make a living.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb394">Each subject is dealt with in a short chapter. </span>
                <span id="dtb395">Haüy gives simple, practical advice on teaching methods and on the production of material for use in object lessons and of a variety of teaching aids.</span>
            </p>
            <div id="page_12" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="12"></div>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb396">He lays particular stress on the methods to be used to teach blind children to read and write and on how to produce raised print books. </span>
                <span id="dtb397">An entire chapter is dedicated to explaining how blind pupils can be trained as compositors. </span>
                <span id="dtb398">He also attempts to demonstrate that those blind pupils who did learn some kind of handicraft (at Quinze-Vingt, for example) were able to earn their own living. </span>
                <span id="dtb399">Haüy therefore recommends that teaching of the blind should include activities such as the production of walking sticks and hairnets, sewing, bookbinding, etc.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb400">Haüy also insists that blind pupils should study history, geography and music. </span>
                <span id="dtb401">In the chapter on the teaching of geography, he mentions Maria Theresia von Paradis and stresses the importance of tactile maps and the terrestrial globe to
                    illustrate the concepts of countries, lakes, rivers, mountains, etc. </span>
                <span id="d910e1914">
                    <span id="dtb402">He goes on to describe the method of producing maps developed by von Paradis and Weissenburg </span>

                    <span id="dtb405">As for music and the possibility of a blind person's earning his living as a musician, Haüy points to von Paradis's success and her system of raised musical notes </span>

            <p>
                <span id="dtb408">When he touches on the teaching of mathematics, Haüy affirms that although he admires Saunderson and Weissenburg's "arithmetic boards", he firmly believes that blind
                    and sighted children should be taught together and for this reason he does not agree with the use of special mathematical teaching aids for blind children. </span>
                <span id="dtb409">Haüy does recognise that blind pupils may need some kind of assistance when drawing geometrical figures, for example, and had paper templates for this purpose.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="d910e1950">
                    <span id="dtb410">Haüy's invention, a method of producing raised letters on paper with the types he had cast, was completely new </span>
                    <a id="dtb411" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_38">38</a>

                </span>
                <span id="dtb413">He now saw as his principle task to attempt to produce as many copies of books for the blind as possible. </span>
                <span id="dtb414">He wanted every blind child to have his or her own collection of raised print books. </span>
                <span id="dtb415">In time he designed and had made a printing press which could produce raised print and to which he added a device for dyeing the raised letters black. </span>
                <span id="d910e1971">
                    <span id="dtb416">The first two books printed by Haüy for his blind pupils were produced in this way </span>
                    <a id="dtb417" epub:type="noteref" class="noteref" href="C00000-12-footnotes.xhtml#fn_39">39</a>
                    <span id="dtb418">. </span>
                </span>
                <span id="dtb419">One was his own treatise on education for the blind: Essai sur l'Education des Enfans-Aveugles (1786); the other a historical review of the institute's first five
                    years of existence entitled Notice Historique de l'Institution des Enfans-Aveugles (1791).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="dtb420">Haüy believed that his printing method would make it possible for the blind to print books not only for their own use but also for the sighted. </span>
                <span id="dtb421">He dreamed of a time when his blind pupils would become teachers of sighted children; the blind teacher and the sighted pupils would read from the same book. </span>
                <span id="dtb422">Haüy's method was, however, a form of printing, that is, it involved typographic composition, so to enable the blind to correspond with the sighted in a simpler
                    fashion, Haüy designed a "writing board" on which the writer wrote with a steel pen which had an undivided nib. </span>
                <span id="dtb423">His idea was that the blind person should write his letter by hand on the one side of a suitable type of paper. </span>
                <span id="dtb424">This would produce raised letters on the other side of the paper, letters which the writer himself would be able to read by touch. </span>
                <span id="d910e2006">
                    <span id="dtb425">Unfortunately, his apparatus was not of much use to those who had never seen letters </span>

            <p>
                <span id="dtb428">The school in the Rue Victoires did more than provide its blind pupils with a basic education, it also taught them a useful trade. </span>
                <span id="dtb429">Their teachers believed in the positive value of work. </span>
                <span id="dtb430">The children spun thread, wove, knitted, made leather belts and hairnets, etc. </span>
                <span id="dtb431">They produced raised print but also printed in ink. </span>
                <span id="d910e2034">
                    <span id="dtb432">Towards the end of his essay on the education of the blind, </span>

                    <span id="dtb434"> there are ten or so examples of the blind children's printing activities (invitation cards, announcements, invoices, prospectuses, etc.). </span>
                </span>
                <span id="dtb435">Although Haüy had raised scores made, he did not at first consider music to be anything more than an entertainment for the blind.</span>

                    <span id="dtb555">According to Skrébitsky, the Russian government asked Haüy's advice on the personal qualities and qualifications required of the new director of the St Petersburg
                        institute for the blind, and on the economic compensation Haüy was willing to accept to take on the responsibility of setting up the institute. </span>
                    <span id="dtb556">The Russian government also wanted to know how much the project would cost. </span>
                    <span id="dtb557">As to the necessary qualities and qualifications of the director of the institute, Haüy (according to Skrébitsky) would have answered that this person should be
                        selected from amongst those teachers who had a good knowledge of Russian and French and, if possible, German. </span>
                    <span id="dtb558">The Director must also have an elementary knowledge of practical activities such as spinning, knitting, the making of hairnets, different kinds of weaving, etc. </span>
                    <span id="dtb559">Haüy furthermore pointed out that the director must be familiar with the art of printing if he was to fulfil his task. </span>
                    <span id="dtb560">Only an amateur's knowledge of music was required, however. </span>
                    <span id="dtb561">Haüy added that apart from these basic qualifications, the director must have a good head on his shoulders, be gentle and patient and have a love for mankind in
                        general.</span>

                <p>
                    <span id="dtb562">Haüy asked his imperial highness for an annual salary of at least <span id="d910e2586" class="num-with-space">40 000</span> roubles, of which half would be paid
                        in advance when Haüy began his work. </span>
                    <span id="dtb563">He also asked the crown to provide, at no cost to himself, a furnished house, light and fuel.</span>

                <p>
                    <span id="dtb564">Finally, he asked for <span id="d910e2601" class="num-with-space">2 000</span> roubles in advance, as travel allowance for himself and his blind pupil. </span>
                    <span id="dtb565">Haüy did not ask for travel allowances for his wife and son, who accompanied him to Russia. </span>
                    <span id="dtb566">He estimated the costs of inventories, including teaching material such as maps and a globe, at <span id="d910e2610" class="num-with-space">4 500</span> francs
                        and the annual operating costs, including salaries, at <span id="d910e2613" class="num-with-space">54 700</span> francs. </span>
                    <span id="dtb567">The institute should be staffed by three teachers, one of them a music teacher, and a manager for the printing works.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb568">Haüy estimated that costs would decrease as the pupils progressed in their activities. </span>
                    <span id="dtb569">This he based on his experience in Paris where his pupils, once they had acquired a certain degree of skill in handicrafts and printing were able to make a profit
                        for the institute. </span>
                    <span id="dtb570">Haüy was convinced that his experience in Paris could be transferred to St Petersburg, which shows how little he knew about the country he was about to

                        <span id="dtb598">Skrébitsky says that he has found the letter in question and that it had a note in the margin (with a signature which probably belonged to the Minister of the
                            General Education, Count Zawadowsky) which read, "The Tsar ordered this bill to be paid, premises to be found for the institute and a director who would learn Haüy's

                    <span id="dtb602">The person who became head of the new institute for the blind was a certain Bouchoueff, who taught at a school in St Petersburg and claimed he was sufficiently
                        fluent in French to be able to converse with Haüy and learn his pedagogical ideas. </span>
                    <span id="dtb603">Bouchoueff was to live in Haüy's house. </span>
                    <span id="dtb604">A report from the ministry dated 10th March 1807 shows that Haüy employed two assistants to work with Bouchoueff and himself. </span>
                    <span id="dtb605">Fournier, Haüy's blind pupil, helped to instruct these assistants. </span>
                    <span id="dtb606">Haüy invited public officials and members of the Russian Academy of Science to be present during Fournier's lectures, hoping to enlist their support. </span>
                    <span id="dtb607">However, there were still no blind pupils. </span>
                    <span id="dtb608">Haüy was told that the lack of pupils arose from the fact that there were no blind people in Russia. </span>
                    <span id="dtb609">To this, Haüy replied:</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote id="dtb610">
                    <p>
                        <span id="dtb611">"If no blind people are to be seen on the streets, this is because the head of the family keeps them at home and because orphans and the children of imperial
                            serfs are placed in asylums. </span>
                        <span id="dtb612">It was not long before events proved my assumption to be correct, not to mention the blind beggars who had escaped the surveillance of the police and to whom
                            I hastened to give alms. </span>
                        <span id="dtb613">I would gladly have quadrupled the alms had they consented to regard the money as a daily wage in exchange for their work."</span>

                    <span id="dtb616">At this time, St Petersburg was a town with a multicultural population. </span>
                    <span id="dtb617">There were many families of French origin; French was, in fact, the language used by the educated classes; reviews and newspapers were published in French. </span>
                    <span id="dtb618">In his quest for pupils, Haüy placed advertisements in Le Lycée, a review, and in the daily Gazette de Petersbourg. </span>
                    <span id="dtb619">These advertisements brought him two new pupils, both of foreign extraction.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb620">After some time, a Russian woman came to Haüy asking him to help her blind son who was an inmate of the asylum in Smolny . </span>
                    <span id="dtb621">Haüy went to Smolny where he found several blind children living with the aged and the handicapped inmates. </span>
                    <span id="dtb622">He took the son of the woman who had asked for his help back to St Petersburg with him and asked the authorities for permission to teach the other blind children
                        in Smolny. </span>
                    <span id="dtb623">The children were to be picked up by coach, in twos, and later returned to the asylum. </span>
                    <span id="dtb624">Haüy himself would undertake to teach the boys, while his wife would teach the little girls. </span>
                    <span id="dtb625">The director of the Smolny asylum, however, refused to give his permission. </span>
                    <span id="dtb626">Haüy then sent a written request to the "Committee for General Beneficence" and later to the "Civil Governor", who promised to grant Haüy's request as soon as he
                        found time to do so. </span>
                    <span id="dtb627">He never had, however, any spare time. </span>
                    <span id="dtb628">In the same document (dated 10th March 1807), Haüy also complained about his cramped lodgings which made it impossible for him to take in more than one blind
                        pupil at a time. </span>
                    <span id="dtb629">His other pupil, from Moscow, had to lodge elsewhere in the town. </span>
                    <span id="dtb630">Haüy asked the authorities to provide him with the house he had been promised to enable him to establish his school under more suitable conditions. </span>
                    <span id="d910e2877">
                        <span id="dtb631">In his letter Haüy also mentioned his two assistants and praised Bouchoueff, but complained about the latter's " weak health, which permitted him to dedicate
                            only half-days to studies which required at least a year of continuous dedication" </span>

                    <span id="dtb634">Was it for tactical reasons that Haüy praised Bouchoueff, who obviously did not make any major contribution to the work of the institute? </span>
                    <span id="d910e2895">
                        <span id="dtb635">Haüy did not receive much help from his two assistants either, since they drank and turned out to be generally inept </span>

                    </span>
                    <span id="dtb638">Two other persons, however, announced their interest in teaching at Haüy's school. </span>
                    <span id="dtb639">They were Galitch, a student at the Institute of Pedagogy in St Petersburg, and Louet, a French immigrant (a naturalized Russian citizen), who offered to give
                        music classes.</span>

                <div id="page_18" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="18"></div>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb640">Galitch taught a pupil who came from the Kronstadt fortress in the Bay of Finland and who spoke only Russian. </span>
                    <span id="dtb641">According to Skrébitsky, Bouchoueff had already lost heart in his work.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb642">Haüy had intended to reproduce the printing works he had had at the Institution des Jeunes Aveugles. </span>
                    <span id="dtb643">A printing press was a major investment, but it had paid off well in Paris, and had, in fact, been the means of earning a regular income for the blind pupils and
                        the institute. </span>
                    <span id="dtb644">Haüy valued very highly the trades associated with printing. </span>
                    <span id="dtb645">In the document dated 10th March 1807, he asked permission to establish a printing works at the institute, where not only ordinary books and books in raised print
                        for the blind could be produced, but also such articles as visiting cards and other texts not subject to official censorship. </span>
                    <span id="dtb646">Finally, he asked to be given the use of one of the crown's empty buildings for his institute, and to be allowed to select young blind people who could benefit
                        from his teaching methods from the asylums, especially the Smolny asylum. </span>
                    <span id="dtb647">He also wished to appoint staff to take charge of the administration of the institute.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb648">In his petition, Haüy also stressed that he had agreed to teach according to his methods for a period of one year, but that to date he had only been allowed to
                        teach one pupil. </span>
                    <span id="dtb649">By May 1807, Haüy still had no premises and once again sent a petition to the Minister of General Education in which he referred to former unfulfilled promises. </span>
                    <span id="dtb650">He had been given a building, but it turned out to be unsuitable for a school. </span>
                    <span id="dtb651">He further mentioned that attempts were still being made to convince him that there were no blind people in Russia, but that he had seen the many blind beggars
                        for himself and had also seen many blind children in Smolny whom he would gladly teach.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb652">It has already been said that Haüy did have a few pupils, one of whom lived in his house. </span>
                    <span id="dtb653">As there was no reaction from the minister, Haüy, who now only had four months of his contract left, decided to occupy the building offered in spite of the fact
                        that it was not in a fit condition to house a school. </span>
                    <span id="dtb654">Bouchoueff was still unwell and of little use to him. </span>
                    <span id="dtb655">His two assistants, Galitch and Louet, however, did an excellent job.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb656">Once again Haüy asked to be allowed to select some blind children from the Smolny asylum as pupils. </span>
                    <span id="dtb657">Skrébitsky states that he found no answer to this letter, although he did discover a decision by the tsar, dated 10th August 1807, giving Haüy permission to teach
                        15 pupils at an annual cost of <span id="d910e2986" class="num-with-space">14 150</span> roubles with an extra allowance of <span id="d910e2989" class="num-with-space">5
                            185</span> roubles, but this did not solve Haüy's problems. </span>
                    <span id="dtb658">Now the authorities concerned began to harass him and demand that he should deduct the amount granted from what he had previously received. </span>
                    <span id="dtb659">In addition, a heated debate ensued on the carriage required by Haüy to transport his purchases to the institute. </span>
                    <span id="dtb660">The discussion ended when the tsar ordered General Hitrowo to tell Haüy to conduct himself in a proper manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb661">Prior to that curt, rather perfunctory decision, Baron Dolst, director of secondary schools, had been ordered to inspect Haüy's school. </span>
                    <span id="dtb662">The inspection was preceded by a letter from Haüy to the minister of education, in which he wrote:</span>
                </p>

                            answer that this is quite correct but that the note referred to clearly states that there were two conditions: 1. </span>
                        <span id="dtb665">That I would be given a sufficient number of blind pupils;2. </span>

                    <span id="dtb678">This letter clearly shows that at this time relations between Haüy and Bouchoueff were extremely strained.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb679">Baron Dolst admitted in his report after his inspection of the institute (13th August 1808) that the premises to which it had moved were not suitable, located as
                        they were on the fourth floor, with the dormitories next to the earth closets. </span>
                    <span id="dtb680">As to the teaching at the institute, Dolst affirmed that he could find no differences in knowledge between the pupils taught by Haüy and those taught by
                        Bouchoueff. </span>
                    <span id="dtb681">He did find that a few pupils had made considerable progress in reading after following Haüy's methods, but that printing had had to be abandoned for lack of
                        typecast. </span>
                    <span id="dtb682">Basket-making and straw plaiting for chair bottoms were taught at the institute; the girls learned how to make hairnets and to knit. </span>
                    <span id="dtb683">Dolst considered that the teaching of handicrafts had achieved good results.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb684">As for the teaching of music, however, Dolst was not satisfied. </span>
                    <span id="dtb685">The children had learnt only three French and two Italian songs. </span>
                    <span id="dtb686">The Baron did not find this lack of progress so remarkable, since the songs were all in foreign languages. </span>
                    <span id="dtb687">He therefore suggested that the immigrant Louet should be replaced by a Russian music teacher who would be assisted by a blind person by the name of
                        Shiline.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb688">After the inspection, Haüy asked Dolst if he might hand in his resignation and leave the institute together with Fournier and Louet. </span>
                    <span id="dtb689">Dolst submitted Haüy's letter of resignation to the minister of education. </span>
                    <span id="dtb690">In it he asked to be relieved of his duties because of the serious conflict between himself and Bouchoueff.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb691">According to Skrébitsky, neither Dolst's report nor Haüy's letter of resignation had any effect, and Haüy continued as head of the institute until 1817. </span>
                    <span id="dtb692">Bouchoueff, too, retained his post at the institute and shortly afterwards disbanded the girls' section (which consisted of three pupils).</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb693">Skrébitsky claims to have found notes by an anonymous writer in one of the archives. </span>
                    <span id="dtb694">These notes proved that the original intention was to admit two categories of pupils to the institute: the poor, who would learn reading, writing, typesetting,
                        music and handicrafts, and the well-to-do, who would learn writing, geography, poetry, etc. </span>
                    <span id="dtb695">Religion would be a compulsory subject for both social groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb696">The author of the note was of the opinion that the Rosminazoffs' house, where the institute was located, was very suitable in spite of the fact that both Baron
                        Dolst and Haüy thought the contrary. </span>
                    <span id="dtb697">He was also very critical of Haüy, who he found had made improper use of his position by appropriating the best rooms for his own personal use.</span>

                <p>
                    <span id="dtb698">The children's dormitory was cold in winter and stiflingly hot in summer. </span>
                    <span id="dtb699">To make matters worse, they were obliged to pass through the bedroom to empty their chamber pots. </span>
                    <span id="dtb700">Music classes, study and a variety of activities were held in the general classroom while normal classes were going on. </span>
                    <span id="dtb701">At one table, pupils were taught reading or grammar, at another arithmetic. </span>
                    <span id="dtb702">The space for printing works was in one corner, while in the centre of the room, pupils played the piano or the violin. </span>
                    <span id="dtb703">The anonymous author added that Haüy's son or his pupil Fournier sometimes amused themselves by adding to the general noise by starting up the lathe in order to
                        disturb the Russian teachers at their work, and so that later they would be able to criticise their methods.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb704">The unknown critic also took a very negative view of the teaching of handicrafts. </span>
                    <span id="dtb705">It had, for example, taken a whole year to teach a pupil to plait and the finished result was a mere half archine which would only fetch 10 kopeks. </span>
                    <span id="dtb706">He also noted that the printing press was used only to print brochures about Haüy's telegraph, with the result that the type was worn and could not be used for
                        its original purpose. </span>
                    <span id="dtb707">The author accused Fournier, who was in charge of these activities, of deliberately destroying the type. </span>
                    <span id="dtb708">The lathe was in equally bad shape, the music teaching deficient, etc. </span>
                    <span id="dtb709">The author ends by suggesting that the French teachers should be dismissed and replaced by Russians.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb710">Haüy very much resented what he considered to be harassment which Skrébitsky believes Bouchoueff was responsible for. </span>
                    <span id="dtb711">In a letter dated 19th August 1808, Haüy asked Count Zawadowsky (the minister of education) to order Baron Dolst to continue his inspections and demanded that
                        examinations should be held in French in the presence of witnesses. </span>
                    <span id="dtb712">Haüy wanted to be able to refute any criticism which might be made of his work and had no desire to be at the mercy of the caprice of a single judge. </span>
                    <span id="dtb713">This letter was followed by another to Baron Dolst, in which Haüy asked to be allowed to participate in decisions concerning the final organisation of the
                        institute. </span>
                    <span id="dtb714">He yet again asked to be moved to more suitable premises and requested a list of poor blind children who might be admitted to the institute and another of
                        well-to-do children who might be potential pupils.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb715">Bouchoueff died before Haüy left Russia. </span>
                    <span id="dtb716">According to Skrébitsky, there are no sources which might explain why Haüy stayed in Russia for as long as eleven years, in spite of all adversities. </span>
                    <span id="dtb717">An official document dated 6th May 1817 makes it clear that Haüy wished to leave the institute. </span>
                    <span id="dtb718">It is a letter is addressed to Prince Galitzin (who had replaced Zawadowsky as minister of education). </span>
                    <span id="dtb719">In it, Haüy asks to be removed from office or to be granted six months leave for himself and Fournier. </span>
                    <span id="dtb720">As Haüy was in a state of ill health by this time, Galitzin agreed to his dismissal, stating that he would thus be able to end his days in the bosom of his
                        family. </span>
                    <span id="dtb721">The French ambassador requested permission to take Haüy and Fournier back to France aboard a warship which was soon to leave. </span>
                    <span id="dtb722">The Tsar gave his approval to the application and on Haüy's departure decorated him with the Order of Saint Vladimir, fourth class.</span>

                            prepare the blind pupils for a trade. (4) For Fournier's post, the ministry should appoint the three blind pupils Smourof, Vemblad and Stiaguine and have them divide his

                <p>
                    <span id="dtb738">At an early date, Haüy had become interested in the abbé l'épée's teaching of the deaf. </span>
                    <span id="dtb739">Skrébitsky (1884) says that in 1784, the abbé l'épée on one occasion himself entrusted Haüy with the teaching of a deaf person. </span>
                    <span id="dtb740">Skrébitsky's source was probably a footnote in Haüy's Essai sur l'Education des Aveugles. </span>
                    <span id="dtb741">In one chapter, Haüy writes that he wished to compare the teaching of the blind with that of the deaf. </span>
                    <span id="dtb742">This chapter, however, is mainly a panegyric dedicated to the abbé l'épée. </span>
                    <span id="dtb743">In passing, however, Haüy says that he can testify to the fact that it is much easier to teach the blind than the deaf. </span>
                    <span id="dtb744">In the footnote mentioned, Haüy states that he had had the opportunity of following the progress of a young deaf man who had been shipwrecked and washed ashore on
                        the coast of Normandy. </span>
                    <span id="dtb745">Haüy also promised that the partially deaf man would write his autobiography and that his blind pupils would print it. </span>
                    <span id="dtb746">That promise, to the best of my knowledge, was never kept.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="dtb747">In October 1807, a Russian lady approached Haüy and asked him to teach her deaf daughter. </span>
                    <span id="dtb748">According to Skrébitsky's sources, Haüy commented on this as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote id="dtb749">
                    <p>
                        <span id="dtb750">"She imagined that I would agree to teach her daughter, Eugénie, who had been tormented by deafness since her early years. </span>
                        <span id="dtb751">In vain I tried to dissuade her, on the pretext of my lack of practical experience of this difficult art, which often surpasses the capacity of even the very
                            well-prepared. </span>
                        <span id="dtb752">Eventually I had to give in and accept. </span>
                        <span id="dtb753">The very limited progress I made with her soon attracted attention and further pupils were sent to me."</span>

                    <span id="dtb755">Haüy invited the public to observe his efforts in order to show the progress which could be made by means of methods of teaching the deaf which had developed in
                        France. </span>
                    <span id="dtb756">His work aroused great surprise and admiration, although there were also sceptics. </span>
                    <span id="dtb757">Skrébitsky quotes Haüy, who recounts an incident which occurred during one of his public classes:</span>

                        <span id="dtb759">"One day, during one of my classes, when I had just finished praising the abbé l'épée and the abbé Sicard and was commenting on my admiration of the
                            intelligence usually shown by my deaf-dumb pupils, a member of the audience pointed out that these children, whom Nature had treated so unkindly, only repeated, in
                            parrot-fashion, what had been poured into their minds by their teachers. </span>
                        <span id="dtb760">The person in question was suggesting that it was useless to teach this type of pupil. </span>
                        <span id="dtb761">Considering all that has been achieved by the famous men who developed these teaching methods, this asseveration appeared to me a mockery of their talents and
