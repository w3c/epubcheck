            <p>What does it mean to be human if we don't have a shared culture? What does a shared
                culture mean if we can't share it? It's only in the last 100, or 150 years or so,
                that we started tightly restricting how that culture gets used.</p>
            <p>The Internet enabled an infrastructure where anybody could participate without asking
                permission. We have all these new technologies that allow people to express
                themselves, take control of their own creative impulses, but the law's getting in
                the way.</p>
            <p>Creative Commons is designed to save the world from failed sharing. People who
                actually want to share stuff, who put it up on the web because they want to share it
                under certain terms.</p>
            <img class="left" src="../images/326261902_3fa36f548d.jpg"
                alt="child against a wall" />
            <p>So we wanted to create a simple way, for creators to say to the world here's the
                freedom that I want to run with my creative work. Here are the things you're allowed
                to do. Can I reproduce it, can I copy it, can I put it in my text book? Can I use
                that photograph? Can I make a new version of it? Creative Commons gives tools to
                creators to make a choice about copyright.</p>
            <p>Creative Commons licence can cover anything that copyright covers. Every licence says
                "You need to give me attribution. I created this, give me credit for the work I
                did." The basic choices are commercial use, or not. Can you make derivative works,
                versions, adaptations or not? And do you want me to have to share alike?</p>
            <p>So if I take your stuff, do I have to offer it to the next person under the same
                terms? There's no requirement for you to do anything with your work other than what
                you want to do. You own the copyright to it. What we've done is given you the right
                to exercise your copyright in more ways, more simply.</p>

                alt="the blue sky with an ampersand-shaped cloud" />
            <p>So the idea here is to enable the creative impulses that the technology turns loose,
                and get the law out of the way. The work of Creative Commons is really about laying
                the infrastructure and ground work for this new type of culture.</p>
            <p>A new kind of Folk Culture. Somebody from Delhi, somebody from New York, somebody
                from Singapore, can feel comfortable using photo that was created and given away by
                somebody in The United States, or in China, or wherever that the licenses have been
                extended to. With their identity being preserved. Which means that people can
                actually create new kinds of things, come together and build things.</p>
            <p>Mash-ups that people can do with peoples Flicker photos. And CCmixter has allowed
                artists to make music together. It's really about creativity and connection. Access
                and control. From amateurs who simply for the love of what they are doing and they
                want to share it and they want other people to be able to make use of it, to
                commercial organizations.</p>
            <p>In the end, this will have a very successful place in the for profit economy.
                Creative Commons is the bridge to this future. You've got to move away from thinking
                about content to thinking about communities. Communities that develop around content
                and the sharing that the licences allow enable these communities to come
                together.</p>
            <p>A physical Commons like a park where anybody can enter equally, a Commons with
                intellectual works is actually much freer. It really is going to be the pillar for
                communications between people, cultural exchanges. The space for more speech, more
                free expression. And that's the kind of Commons we're trying to create.</p>
