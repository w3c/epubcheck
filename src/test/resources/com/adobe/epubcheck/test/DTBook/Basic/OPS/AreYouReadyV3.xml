								<p><sent smilref="speechgen0006.smil#tcp86" id="dtb93">It is a good idea to pick two or three emergency contacts, one who lives outside of your local area code in addition to one who lives within and also someone who can receive text messages. </sent><sent id="dtb94" smilref="speechgen0006.smil#tcp87">In major disasters one can often call a number outside your area code but not within. </sent><sent id="dtb95" smilref="speechgen0006.smil#tcp88">In extreme cases, people have had to rely on text messaging when phone lines and towers were decimated in the disaster. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0006.smil#tcp89" id="dtb96">After Hurricane Katrina cell phones were just about useless to make calls in the affected areas, but they saved many lives and helped reunite families thanks to their text messaging capabilities that survived. </sent></p>
